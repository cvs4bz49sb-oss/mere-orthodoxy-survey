It is painful to watch how much this is not being modeled by a huge majority of evangelical conservative Protestant churches, pastors, faith leaders, Christian radio, Christian media, all of it.   As a parent it is making so much extra work for me.

My kids are having trouble squaring that with anything they know of Christianity, and yet\u2026 It is a distinctly Christian language that is coming out of these very people that my children don't respect.

I now believe that conservative protestantism is in desperate need of a movement that intentionally rejects 'evangelicalism' as such. Instead, I think our moment calls for a pivot toward reviving a more institutional, high-church-minded, magisterial protestantism. Mere O' has produced some excellent articles on this topic which have helped me think through and articulate my own views. I would love to see my own denomination, the PCA, move in this direction and spearhead a cross-denominational 'magisterial' movement in America along with some other conservative Lutheran, Reformed, and Anglican denominations, and also work to strengthen ecumenical ties with conservative Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions as well.|\n202|45-54|Female|TX|Member/Lay Person, Parachurch Ministry|Protestant|Non-Denominational|Podcast: Christians Reading Classics, Substack|Occasionally|Church, Culture, Book Reviews, Education|Comment Magazine|More in-depth theological content, More cultural commentary, More podcast content||I don\u2019t follow any of those publications listed above but it wouldn\u2019t let me not choose one\n203|75+|Male|Pennsylvania|Pastor|Catholic|(Not Protestant)|Newsletter / Email Digest|Weekly|Church, Culture, Theology, Book Reviews, Politics, Philosophy|First Things|More in-depth theological content||William Warnky\n204|35-44|Male|Missouri|Academic|Protestant|Pentecostal|Website articles, Newsletter / Email Digest|A few times per week|Church, Culture, Family, Formation, Philosophy, Education|Mars Hill Audio Journal, Comment Magazine, First Things, Christianity Today, The Gospel Coalition, UnHerd, The Free Press, Word on Fire|More in-depth theological content, More cultural commentary|Trying to raise children (and teach college students) in Christian formation in the face of \"liquid modernity\" is an on-going struggle.

I want to be aware of the times in which we live, yet able to lend perspective and wisdom that I have hopefully accrued over 40 years of study and pastoral ministry, to see a binding together of the generations around the gospel and the good Lord who is at its center.|Thanks for your good work.\n315|55-64|Male|Hong kong|Not currently attending church|Protestant|Baptist|Newsletter / Email Digest|Occasionally|Church, Culture, Technology, Theology, Politics, Philosophy, Leadership, Education|The Free Press|More in-depth theological content, More cultural commentary, Topical ebooks||\n316|65-74|Male|Illinois|Member/Lay Person|Protestant|Other|Newsletter / Email Digest|Weekly|Church, Culture, Family, Formation, Theology, Philosophy, Education|The Gospel Coalition, Christianity Today, The Dispatch|More in-depth theological content, More cultural commentary, Regional in-person events|The Dark Night of the (my) Soul|Bill Warner bill.warner51@gmail.com\n317|45-54|Male|Ontario|Not currently attending church|Catholic|(Not Protestant)|Website articles|Occasionally|Church, Culture, Technology, Theology, Book Reviews, Politics, Philosophy, Interviews|Substack Newsletters, First Things, The Lamp, Christianity Today|More cultural commentary|Doubt|\n318|45-54|Male|West Virginia|Elder/Deacon|Protestant|Presbyterian|Newsletter / Email Digest|Weekly|Church, Culture, Formation, Theology, Book Reviews, Leadership|First Things, The Dispatch|Regional in-person events|The church failing to live up to her calling|\n319|35-44|Male|Western Australia|Pastor|Protestant|Anglican|Podcast: Mere Fidelity, Newsletter / Email Digest|Monthly|Theology, Philosophy|Plough, UnHerd, First Things, The Lamp, Substack Newsletters|More in-depth theological content, More podcast content|Spiritual loneliness|\n320|55-64|Male|Ontario|Member/Lay Person|Protestant|Anglican|Website articles|Weekly|Interviews|The Bulwark, Plough, Substack Newsletters|More video content||\n321|25-34|Male|TN|Pastor, Academic|Protestant|Non-Denominational|Newsletter / Email Digest|Weekly|Church, Formation, Book Reviews, Education|Word on Fire, The Gospel Coalition, Substack Newsletters, Pints with Aquinas, Christianity Today, Gavin Ortlund / Truth Unites, The Free Press|More in-depth theological content|Understanding how to make complex inaccessible materials accessible to the general public without \"showing off\" or intimidating them|\n322|45-54|Male|Ohio|Member/Lay Person|Protestant|Baptist|Website articles, Podcast: Mere Fidelity, Social media (X, Facebook, etc.)|Monthly|Church, Culture, Family, Formation, Technology, Theology, Book Reviews, Politics, Philosophy, Interviews, Education|Pints with Aquinas, First Things, American Reformer, The Free Press|More in-depth theological content, Regional in-person events|Structure in putting it all together|Love all that you guys are doing.\n323|25-34|Male|Southampton, United Kingdom (would love access to print journals!!)|Member/Lay Person|Protestant|Anglican|Website articles, Podcast: Christians Reading Classics|A few times per week|Church, Formation, Theology, Politics|Christianity Today, Pints with Aquinas|More in-depth theological content, More cultural commentary|Understanding how and why Christianity has become such a minority, specifically in the Uk considering everything in this country was built on Christian morals, ethics and traditions.|I try spend as little time looking at a screen as I possibly can, I even print out all the articles I want to read from mere orthodoxy so I don\u2019t have to use a tech device.

I praise God for the work of MereO and am so grateful for the work you all are doing.\n176|65-74|Female|Member/Lay Person|Protestant|Presbyterian|Website articles|A few times per week|Church, Culture, Theology, Philosophy, Leadership|The Gospel Coalition|Appreciate the theological and cultural perspectives|Topical ebooks||\n177|25-34|Male|Member/Lay Person|Protestant|Presbyterian|Website articles, Podcast: Mere Fidelity, Substack, Discord|A few times per week|Church, Culture, Family, Formation, Technology, Theology, Book Reviews, Politics, Philosophy, Interviews, Leadership, Education|First Things, Sola Media, Substack Newsletters, WORLD Opinions, Gavin Ortlund / Truth Unites, The Gospel Coalition, Christianity Today|Join the online community (the Discord), Get the print Journal|More in-depth theological content, More cultural commentary, Regional in-person events, Topical ebooks|Worship, as Presbyterian with great liturgical love|Ian, we gotta set up a Dallas event already like cmon man there are so many of us\n178|65-74|Male|Elder/Deacon|Protestant|Anglican|Website articles, Podcast: Mere Fidelity|Weekly|Church, Culture, Family, Theology, Book Reviews|WORLD Opinions, First Things|Appreciate the theological and cultural perspectives|More podcast content||\n179|25-34|Male|Member/Lay Person|Protestant|Presbyterian|Website articles, Newsletter / Email Digest|Monthly|Church, Culture, Family, Technology, Theology, Book Reviews, Politics, Philosophy, Interviews, Education|First Things|Support the mission, Get the print Journal, Appreciate the theological and cultural perspectives, Support for Christians Reading Classics|More in-depth theological content, More cultural commentary|Relationship of the church to informing the societal norms that inform the state and legal systems|\n180|55-64|Male|Elder/Deacon|Protestant|Baptist|Website articles, Newsletter / Email Digest|A few times per week|Church, Culture, Family, Formation, Theology, Book Reviews, Philosophy, Interviews, Leadership, Education|Comment Magazine, The Free Press, The Gospel Coalition, First Things, Christianity Today, Mars Hill Audio Journal|Appreciate the theological and cultural perspectives|Topical ebooks|time|Your matter, insight, and overall ALL your offerings are Great!

The other challenge is figuring out how to disciple my kids in a poor urban community that is segregated and impacted by historical injustices. Trying to encourage church leadership to both care deeply for the poor community that our church is placed in while also holding to the orthodoxy that feels like is being eroded from our identity as a congregation.  Walking this line is a tension.|Love your book recommendations and thoughtful articles.\n183|35-44|Male|Member/Lay Person|Protestant|Baptist|Podcast: Mere Fidelity, Social media (X, Facebook, etc.), Newsletter / Email Digest|Weekly|Church, Culture, Family, Theology, Politics, Philosophy, Education|First Things, The Dispatch, The Gospel Coalition|Appreciate the theological and cultural perspectives|More in-depth theological content, More cultural commentary, More podcast content|time constraints|\n184|45-54|Male|Elder/Deacon|Protestant|Presbyterian|Website articles, Podcast: Mere Fidelity|Daily|Church, Culture, Family, Formation, Technology, Theology, Book Reviews, Politics, Interviews|The Gospel Coalition, Sola Media|Support the mission, Get the print Journal, Appreciate the theological and cultural perspectives, Support for Mere Fidelity|Regional in-person events|Navigating the AI revolution as a Tech Worker, concerns of how participation would effect my formation and the world around me|It would be nice to have a 'share' option for online articles that are behind the paywall, much like a WSJ subscription will allow a certain number of shares per month.
